# Build Dependency

## Font Awesome Dependency

We have used well-known font awesome in our project instead of .png icons. We have included the .zip file with font awesome .jar files in our project

## Sources folders

We have made two source folders and thus they should be marked as source directories: there are ```main``` and ```java``` files. It was at some point hard to distinguish between urls, relative and absoulte paths in JavaFX.

## Thank you

Thank you for this course!
